```

# Setup

First, clone the [Assignment8][1] repository to your own GitHub account
by forking. Look for the forking button on the GitHub repository page.

You can then modify the repository (namely the `R_Exercises8.Rmd` file)
and complete the assignment by adding your answers in the appropriate
place. Do **NOT** rename the file.

## Completing the assignment

Check your work by knitting the document.

1. Create a level 2 header below in Markdown with the name "Answer 1".

## Answer 1

2. Add an unordered Markdown list of your favorite food dishes and
add their ingredients as sub-items in the list. You should enter at least two
dishes with two ingredients each.

* Guacamole
  * Avocado
  * Tomato
  * Lemon juice
  * Salt
  * Pepper
* Ice Cream
  * Sugar
  * Salt
  * Cream
  * Ice
  * Chocolate

3. Insert an R code chunk below. Show the `summary` of the `Orange` dataset.
Run a linear regression using the `lm` function to predict `circumference` from
`age` and assign the result. Show the `summary` of the fit object that you
assigned.

```{r}
summary(Orange)
fit <- lm(circumference ~ age, data = Orange)
summary (fit)

```

 5:7   Median :1004.0   Median :115.0  
 2:7   Mean   : 922.1   Mean   :115.9

       Max.   :1582.0   Max.   :214.0  

Call:
lm(formula = circumference ~ age, data = Orange)

4. Add an RMarkdown weblink (in link format) below to your favorite R reference
website.

[Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/index.htm)

5. Replace the author field in the `yaml` header with your name and then
successfully `knit` the RMarkdown document into a Word document.


6. Follow the [Pull Request instructions on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
to submit your assignment via GitHub as a Pull Request to the [Assignment8][1]
repository.
